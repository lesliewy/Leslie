tutorialQuick-start tutorial
    This is a quickstart tutorial to help get new users up and running
    in Vimperator. It is not intended as a full reference explaining all
    features.

modalVimperator's modal interface

    Vimperator's power, like Vim's, comes from it's modal interface. Keys have
    different meanings depending on which mode the browser is in. Vimperator has
    several modes, but the 2 most important are Normal mode and
    Command-line mode.

    When Vimperator starts, it is in Normal mode by default. This is probably where
    you will spend the majority of your time.

    The other core mode of Vimperator, Command-line mode, can be entered from
    Normal mode by typing a : (colon). You will frequently see Vimperator
    commands start with a :, indicating that what follows is a command.

    To return to Normal mode from Command-line mode, type <Esc>. Pressing
    <Esc> will also return you to Normal mode from most other modes in
    Vimperator.

getting-helpGetting help

    Vim is a great editor but it's not much of a web browser. So even seasoned Vim
    users will probably have to look at Vimperator documentation sooner or later.
    Most of the documentation for Vimperator's features are easily found using the
    :help command. For example, you can find help on the :help command
    by typing
:help :help

    Similarly, help on configurable options is available with
    :help 'option_name'. (Note the single quotes
    around the option name as in Vim.) Information on all available
    options is, predictably, :help options.
    And you can find out about the gt and gT mapping with
:help gt
:help gT
    Finally, in addition to the help system itself, :exusage, :viusage
    and :optionusage are useful quick-reference commands.

living-mouselessMouseless

C or how I learned to stop worrying and love the 80+ buttons I already have.

    The efficiency of Vimperator, as with the legendary editor it was inspired by,
    relies on the user being able to keep his fingers on the keyboard where they
    can do the most good. While there are some areas where the mouse is clearly
    superior at, such as GUI design or some games, Vimperator acts on the
    assumption that a web browser doesn't have to be one of those. However,
    the mouse is of course fully supported if you prefer moving this little rodent.

keyboard-scrollingScrolling

    Scrolling the browser window is done with simple keystrokes:

    j/k C
        scroll window down/up by one line, respectively
    
    h/l C
        scroll window left/right
    
    <Space>/<C-b> C
        scroll down/up by one page
    
    <C-d>/<C-u> C
        scroll down/up by 1/2 page
    * 还是喜欢半页的翻.    

    Your standard buttons (<Up>/<Down>/<PgUp>/<PgDn>) will
    also work as expected.

history-navigationtab-navigationHistory and tabs

    History navigation (e.g., Back, Forward) are done similarly to
    scrolling.

    <C-o>/<C-i> C
        move Back/Forward in the current window/tab's history, respectively
    * 习惯用H/L,这样容易记住.

    Move between tabs using these keystrokes which may also be familiar to tabbing
    Vimmers.

    gt/<C-n> C
        go to the next tab
    
    gT/<C-p> C
        go to the previous tab
    
    g0/g$ C
        go to the first/last tab
    
    d C
        close the active tab (delete the buffer)
    * 上面这几个都比较常用. 2gT: 回到前一个的前一个tab. 但是不能使用2gt,不明白为什么.    

    To open a web page in a new tab, use the :tabopen url. To open a URL in
    the current tab, use :open. The Normal mode mappings t and o,
    respectively, map to these commands, so the following pairs of sequences are
    equivalent:


:open my.webmail.com
omy.webmail.com

:tabopen vimperator.org
tvimperator.org
    *  习惯用<C-T>,然后Alt+D or Alt+L 来输入url.

hints-tutorialSome hints about surfing…

    So now you can navigate around in Vimperator. But wait… how do you open a
    page or tab linked in a web page? How do you click on all those links
    without your tailed friend?

    The answer is hints. Activating hints displays a number next to every link
    Vimperator can find. To follow the link, simply type the number corresponding
    to the hint, a white number inside a red square by default.

    For text links, there's an additional shortcut; you can type some text
    contained in the link and Vimperator will search all the links it can find and
    only hint the matching links, further narrowing down the list. If the text you
    type uniquely identifies any given link, Vimperator will follow that link
    immediately without any further user input.

    Whichever way you choose to indicate your target link, once Vimperator has
    highlighted the link you want, simply hit <Enter> to open it.

    The most common hint mode is called quick-hints.
    To activate QuickHint mode, press either f or F. The lower-case
    f will open the resulting link in the current tab, while the upper-case
    F will open it in a new tab.
    * 如果是f:  要看网页，是在当前tab打开还是new tab 打开.
    * 如果是F： 一定在new tab打开,不会自动跳转到new tab.  所以最好用F.

    To test it, try this link: Vimperator Homepage.
    Activate QuickHint mode with f or F to highlight all currently
    visible links. Then start typing the text of the link. The link should be
    uniquely identified soon, and Vimperator will open it. Once you're done,
    remember to use <C-o> (History Back) or d (Delete Buffer)
    to return here, depending on which key you used to activate QuickHint mode.

Common issues

    Say you get half-way done typing in a new URL, only to remember that you've
    already got that page open in the previous tab. Your command line might look
    something like this:

:open my.partial.url/fooba

    You can exit the command line and access the already loaded page with the
    following:

<Esc>
    *  就是用 <Esc> 回到正常模式.

vimperatorrcSaving for posterity - vimperatorrc

    Once you get Vimperator set up with your desired options, maps, and commands,
    you'll probably want them to be available the next time you open Vimperator.
    Continuing the Vim theme, this is done with a vimperatorrc file.

    To save your current settings and allow them to be loaded automatically
    next time you start Vimperator, issue the :mkv command.

    This will create the file $HOME/.vimperatorrc containing your settings.
    It is a simple text file, just like a vimrc file and can be easily
    edited to suit your preferences.
    * 默认的nextpattern=\\bnext\\b,^>$,^(>>|?)$,^(>|?),(>|?)$,\\bmore\\b 
            previouspattern=\\bprev|previous\\b,^<$,^(<<|?)$,^(<|?),(<|?)$

quitting-without-menusFind the exit nearest you

    Vimperator supports all of Vim's classic methods of exiting.

    :xall C command to quit and save the current browsing
        session for next time; the default.
    
    :qall C command to quit without saving the session
    
    ZZ C Normal mode mapping equivalent to :xall
    * 一般用ZZ, 相当于之前我常用的 <A+Space>+C.    
    ZQ C Normal mode mapping equivalent to :qall
    
whither-Firefox
Where did Firefox go?
    You might feel pretty disoriented now. Don't worry. This is still Firefox
    underneath. Here are some ways Vimperator allows Firefox to shine through. See
    the :help for these commands and mappings for more information on how to
    make the best use of them.

    :dialog C
        To access some of Firefox's many dialog windows, you can use the
        :dialog command. See :help :dialog.
    
    :bmarks C
        Vimperator provides a new interface to bookmarks, but they're still your
        standard Firefox bookmarks under the hood. :bmark will add a new
        bookmark, while :bmarks will list the bookmarks currently defined.
    
    :history C
        It's exactly what it sounds like. This command will display a colorized,
        scrollable and clickable list of the locations in Vimperator's history.
    
    :emenu C
        Access the Firefox menus through the Vimperator command line.

    Feel free to explore at this point. If you use the :tabopen command,
    remember to use the gt/gT mappings to get back to this page. If
    using the :open command, use the history keys (e.g., H) to return.
    If you get hopelessly lost, just type :help and click the
    Tutorial link to return.

removal
Get me out of here!
    If you've given it a fair shot and determined … TODO

    The Vimperator way to do this is with the command :addons. Issuing this
    command brings up the Firefox Add-ons dialog window; you can then remove it as
    normal, selecting Vimperator from the list and clicking (yes, clicking)
    Uninstall.
    * :dialog addons 和 :addons 一样, 基本上:dialog 已经很全了.

    Alternatively, you can do this the old-fashioned way: re-enable the menubar,
    as above, with :set toolbars=menu, and select Add-ons from the Tools menu.
