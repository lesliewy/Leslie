startup-options
    Command-line options can be passed to Vimperator via the -vimperator Firefox
    option. These are passed as a single string argument.
    E.g., firefox -vimperator ++cmd 'set exrc' +u 'tempRcFile' ++noplugin

+c+c {command}
            Execute a single Ex command after all initialization has been performed. See
            initialization.
        This option can be specified multiple times.

++cmd++cmd {command}
            Execute a single Ex command before any initialization has been performed. See
            initialization.

        This option can be specified multiple times.

+u+u {rcfile}
            The file {rcfile} is used for user initialization commands. If {rcfile} is
            "NORC" then no startup initialization is performed except for the loading of
            plugins, i.e., steps 1. and 2. in initialization are skipped. If {rcfile}
            is "NONE" then plugin loading is also skipped.

++noplugin++noplugin
        Prevents plugin scripts from being loaded at startup. See 'loadplugins'.

Initialization

At startup, Vimperator completes the following tasks in order. 

     Vimperator can perform user initialization commands. When
    one of the following is successfully located, it is executed,
    and no further locations are tried.
        
            $VIMPERATOR_INIT
                $VIMPERATOR_INIT ¡ª May contain a single Ex command (e.g.,
                ":source file").
            
            $MY_VIMPERATORRC
                ~/_vimperatorrc ¡ª Windows only. If this file exists, its contents
                are executed and $MY_VIMPERATORRC set to its path.
            
            
                ~/.vimperatorrc ¡ª If this file exists, its contents are executed.
            
        
    
    
        If 'exrc' is set and the +u command-line option was not
        specified, then any RC file in the current directory is also
        sourced.
    
    
        All directories in 'runtimepath' are searched for a
        "plugin" subdirectory and all yet unloaded plugins are loaded.
        For each plugin directory, all *.{js,vimp} files (including
        those in further subdirectories) are sourced alphabetically. No
        plugins will be sourced if:

        
            'noloadplugins' is set.
            the ++noplugin command-line option was specified.
            the +u=NONE command-line option specified set.
        

        Any particular plugin will not be loaded if it has already been
        loaded (e.g., by an earlier :loadplugins command).
    


The user's ~ (i.e., "home") directory is determined as follows:


    On Unix and Mac, the environment variable  $HOME is used.
    
        On Windows, Vimperator checks for the existence of
        %HOME%, then %USERPROFILE%, and then
        %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%. It uses the first one it
        finds.

:mkv:mkvimperatorrc:mkv[imperatorrc][!] [file]
        
            Write current key mappings and changed options to [file]. If no
            [file] is specified then ~/.vimperatorrc is written unless this file
            already exists. The special version :mkvimperatorrc! will overwrite
            [file] if it exists.
        

        
            Warning: this differs from Vim's behavior which defaults to writing the file
            in the current directory.
