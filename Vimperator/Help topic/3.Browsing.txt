Vimperator overrides nearly all Firefox keys in order to make browsing more
pleasant for Vim users. On the rare occasions when you want to pass a keystroke
to Firefox, or to the web page, and have it retain its original meaning you
have 2 possibilities:

ignore-all-keys<S-Esc><Insert><S-Esc><Insert>
            Disable all Vimperator keys including <Esc> and
            pass them to the next event handler. This is especially useful if
            JavaScript controlled forms (e.g., the RichEdit form fields of
            Gmail) don't work anymore or you want to work with web apps like
            Google Reader which have a lot of useful shortcuts themselves. To
            exit this mode, press <S-Esc> again.

ignore-keyii
            If you only need to pass a single key to a JavaScript form field or another
            extension prefix the key with i. Also works to unshadow Firefox
            shortcuts like <C-o> which are otherwise hidden in Vimperator.

openingOpening web pages

o:o:open:o[pen] [arg1], [arg2], …o
            Open one or more URLs in the current tab.
            Multiple URLs can be separated with 'urlseparator' (default: ", " Note that the
            space after the comma is required.)
            The first URL is opened in the current tab, and all other URLs are
            opened in new tabs.
            Each token is analyzed and in this order:
                Opened as a local file if it is an existing relative or absolute filename.
                    :open /etc/fstab shows the file system table.
                    :open ../other/foo.html in your home directory opens /home/other/foo.html
            
                 Opened with the specified search engine if the
                 token looks like a search string and the first word
                 is the name of a search engine (
                 :open wikipedia linus torvalds opens the Wikipedia entry for
                 linus torvalds). The short name of a search engine
                 is automatically guessed from its name. If you want
                 to set a custom name, you can change it with
                 :dialog searchengines.
            
                Opened with the default search engine or keyword
                (specified with the 'defsearch' option) if the first
                word is no search engine (:open linus torvalds
                opens a Google search for linus torvalds).
           
               Passed directly to Firefox in all other cases
               (:open www.osnews.com, www.slashdot.org
               opens OSNews in the current, and Slashdot in a new
               background tab).
        
            You can use :open -tags linux torvalds to complete bookmarks with
            tag "linux" and which contain "torvalds". Note that -tags support is only
            available for tab completion, not for the actual command.
            The items which are completed on <Tab> are specified in the 'complete'
            option.

t:t:tabopen:tabnew:tabopen[!] [arg1], [arg2], …t
            Just like :open but also uses a new tab for the first URL. When
            used with [!], the tabopen value of the 'activate' option is negated.

T
            Show a :tabopen prompt containing the current URL. Useful if you want to
            go somewhere by editing the URL of the current page.
            * 这个可能有用.

:tabdu :tabduplicate :[count]tabdu[plicate][!]
            Duplicates current tab [count] times. Uses tabopen value of the 'activate'
            option to determine if the last cloned tab should be activated. When used with
            [!], tabopen value is negated.
            * 类似我在xshell ssh 中设置的<S+m>.
O
            Show an :open prompt containing the current URL. Useful if you want to
            go somewhere by editing the URL of the current page.
            * 一般我也是选择 T.

w:winopen:wopen:wino[pen][!] [arg1], [arg2], …w
        Just like :tabopen but opens the resulting web page(s) in a new window.
        * 这个我基本上不用.    

W
            Open one or more URLs in a new window based on current location. Works like
            w but preselects current URL in the :winopen query.

<MiddleMouse>p
            Open (put) a URL based on the current clipboard contents in the current buffer.
            You can also just select (for non-X11 users: copy) some non-URL text, and
            search for it with the default search engine or keyword (specified by the
            'defsearch' option) with p.
        
P
            Open (put) a URL based on the current clipboard contents in a new buffer. Works
            like p but opens a new tab.
        
            Whether the new buffer is activated, depends on the 'activate' option.

gP
            Open (put) a URL based on the current clipboard contents in a new buffer.
            Works like P but inverts the 'activate' option.

<C-x>[count]<C-x>
            Decrements the last number in URL by 1, or by [count] if given. Negative
            numbers are not supported, as this is not generally useful, so the number cannot
            be decremented past 0.

<C-a>[count]<C-a>
        Increments the last number in URL by 1, or by [count] if given.
        * 这2个差不多,对URL中最右边的数字进行递增减.

~
            Open home directory. You can also use the hints and have the probably fastest
            file browser on earth. :)
            * 估计是没见过TC.

navigating

H<C-o>CTRL-O:ba:back:[count]ba[ck] [url]:ba[ck]!CTRL-o
            Go [count] pages back in the browser history. If [url] is specified go back to
            the first matching URL. The special version :back! goes to the beginning
            of the browser history.
            * 习惯用H.        

L<C-i>CTRL-i:fo:fw:forward:[count]fo[rward] [url]:fo[rward]!CTRL-i
            Go [count] pages forward in the browser history. If [url] is specified go
            forward to the first matching URL. The special version :forward! goes to
            the end of the browser history.

:ju:jumps:ju[mps]
        List all jumps aka current tab's history aka session history.
            Current history position is marked with >, jump numbers are counters to be used
            with :back (above zero record) or :forward (below zero record).

gh
        Go home. Opens the homepage in the current tab.

gH
            Go home in a new tab. Opens the homepage in a new tab. Whether the new tab is
            activated or not depends on the 'activate' option.

gu[count]gu
        Go to [count]th parent directory.
        Pressing gu repeatedly would ascend the URL in this order:
            http://www.example.com/path/to/file.txt?query=value#anchor
            http://www.example.com/path/to/file.txt?query=value
            http://www.example.com/path/to/file.txt
            http://www.example.com/path/to/
            http://www.example.com/path/
            http://www.example.com/
            http://example.com/

gU
        Go to the root of the web site.
            gU on http://www.example.com/dir1/dir2/file.htm opens
            http://www.example.com/.
            When browsing a local directory, it goes to the root directory.
        * 这两个也比较常用,原来是转换大小写用的.         

reloading
r
        Force reloading of the current web page.
        * 这个比较常用.
R
        Force reloading of the current web page skipping the cache.
      
:re:reload:re[load][!]
            Reload current web page. Forces reloading of the current page. If [!] is given,
            skip the cache.
        
:reloada:reloadall:reloada[ll][!]
        Reload all pages. Forces reloading of all pages. If [!] is given, skip the cache.
        * 这个也有用, 

Stopping

<C-c><C-c>
        Stop loading the current web page. This only works if there is no selection, otherwise the
           selected text is copied to the clipboard. Usually this duality isn't a problem, as while
           a page is loading, there is seldom a text to copy.
        * 这个也比较常用.        

:st:stop:st[op]
        Stop loading the current web page.


:stopa:stopall:stopa[ll]
        Stop loading all web pages.

writing save-file Writing
:w:write:sav:saveas:sav[eas][!] [file]
            Save current web page to disk. If [file] is omitted, save to the page's
            default filename. Existing documents will only be overwritten if [!] is given.
   *最好就是:w 别写文件名,  :w 相当于 <C+S>.        

quittingsave-sessionQuitting

:q:quit:q[uit]
            Quit current tab. If this is the last tab in the window, close the window. If
            this was the last window, close Vimperator. When quitting Vimperator, the
            session is not stored.

:qa:qall:quita:quitall:quita[ll]
            Quit Vimperator. Quit Vimperator, no matter how many tabs/windows are open.
            The session is not stored.

:wc:wclose:winc:winclose:winc[lose]
        Close window.

:winon:winonly:winon[ly]
        Close all other windows.

:xa:xall:wq:wqa:wqall:wqa[ll]:xa[ll]
            Save the session and quit. Quit Vimperator, no matter how many tabs/windows
            are open. The session is stored. :wq is different from Vim, as it
            closes the window instead of just one tab by popular demand. Complain on the
            mailing list if you want to change that.

ZQ
        Quit and don't save the session. Works like :qall.
    
ZZ
            Quit and save the session. Quit Vimperator, no matter how many tabs/windows
            are open. The session is stored. Works like :xall.

The current directory
:chd:chdir:cd:cd [-|path]
        Change the current directory. :cd - changes to the last directory.

:pw:pwd:pw[d]
        Print the current directory name.
