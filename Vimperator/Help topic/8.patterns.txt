Text search commands
Contents
    Vimperator provides a Vim-like interface to Firefox's standard text search
    functionality. There is no support for using regular expressions in search
    commands as Firefox does not provide native regex support. It is unlikely that
    this will ever be available.

//{pattern}[/]<CR>
        Search forward for the first occurrence of {pattern}.
            If \c appears anywhere in the pattern the whole pattern is handled as though
            'ignorecase' is on. \C forces case-sensitive matching for the whole pattern.
            If \l appears in the pattern only the text of links is searched for a
            match as though 'linksearch' is on. \L forces the entire page to be searched
            for a match.
       * \c \l 这两个常用.

??{pattern}[?]<CR>
        Search backwards for {pattern}.
        {pattern} can use the same modifiers as for /.
        Note: Incremental searching currently only works in the forward direction.

n
        Find next. Repeat the last search 1 time (until count is supported).

N
            Find previous. Repeat the last search 1 time (until count is supported) in the
            opposite direction.

*
        Search forward for the next word under the cursor.

#
        Search backward for the previous word under the cursor.

:noh:nohlsearch:noh[lsearch]
            Remove the search highlighting. The document highlighting is turned back on
            when another search command is used or the 'hlsearch' option is set.
