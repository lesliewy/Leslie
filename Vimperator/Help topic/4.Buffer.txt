Vimperator holds exactly one buffer object for each tab. It is usually an
(X)HTML document with advanced features.

Buffer information
<C-g>
            Print the current file name. Also shows some additional file information like
            file size or the last modified date.

g<C-g>
        Print file information. Same as :pageinfo.
        * 这个比较有用,我还没用过.

:pa:pageinfo:pa[geinfo]
        Show various page information. See :help pageinfo for available options.

gf
            Toggle between rendered and source view. Alternates the page in the current tab
            between a normally rendered view and the internal editor source view.

gF
        
            View source with an external editor. Opens the source code of the current web
            site with the external editor specified by the 'editor' option. For now the
            external editor must be able to download and open files from a remote URL.

:vie:viewsource:vie[wsource][!] [url]
            View source code of current document. If [url] is specified then view the
            source of that document. When [!] is given, it is opened with the external
            editor.

motion scrolling
Motion commands
^0
            Scroll to the absolute left of the document. Unlike in Vim, 0 and ^
            work exactly the same way.
$
        Scroll to the absolute right of the document
        * 如果页面很宽的话,这2个也常用.

<Home>gg[count]gg
            Go to the top of the document. When used with [count] like in 35gg, it
            scrolls to 35% of the document.

<End>G[count]G
            Go to the end of the document. When used with [count] like in 35G, it
            scrolls to 35% of the document.

N%{count}%
        Scroll to {count} percent of the document.

<Left>h[count]h
            Scroll document to the left. If [count] is specified then move [count] times as
            much to the left.
            If the document cannot scroll more, a beep is emitted (unless 'visualbell' is
            set).

<C-e><Down>j[count]j
            Scroll document down. If [count] is specified then move [count] times as much
            down.
            If the document cannot scroll more, a beep is emitted (unless 'visualbell' is
            set).
            * 这里的<C-e>和j效果一样,但在Vim中是完全不一样的.        

<C-y><Up>k[count]k
            Scroll document up. If [count] is specified then move [count] times as much up.
            If the document cannot scroll more, a beep is emitted (unless 'visualbell' is
            set).

<Right>l[count]l
            Scroll document to the right. If [count] is specified then move [count] times
            as much to the right.
            If the document cannot scroll more, a beep is emitted (unless 'visualbell' is
            set).

<C-d>[count]<C-d>
            Scroll window downwards in the buffer. The number of lines is set by the
            'scroll' option which defaults to half a page. If [count] is given 'scroll' is
            first set to this value.

<C-u>[count]<C-u>
            Scroll window upwards in the buffer. The number of lines is set by the
            'scroll' option which defaults to half a page. If [count] is given 'scroll' is
            first set to this value.

<S-Space><PageUp><C-b>[count]<C-b>
        Scroll up a full page. Scroll window [count] pages Backwards (upwards) in the buffer.

<Space><PageDown><C-f>[count]<C-f>
        Scroll down a full page. Scroll window [count] pages Forwards (downwards) in the buffer.

Jumping to elements
<Tab>
        Advance keyboard focus to the next element.

<S-Tab><S-Tab>
        Rewind keyboard focus to the previous element.

gi  [count]gi
            Focus last used input field. If there is no last input field, it focuses the
            first input field. When used with [count] it directly jumps to the [count]th input
            field.
        * 这功能不错,之前一直用的f/F,来输入.        

]f[count]]f
            Focus next frame. Transfer keyboard focus to the [count]th next frame in
            order. The newly focused frame is briefly colored red. Does not wrap.

[f[count][f
            Focus previous frame. Transfer keyboard focus to the [count]th previous frame
            in order. The newly focused frame is briefly colored red. Does not wrap.


]][count]]]
            Follow the link labeled next or >
            if it exists. Useful when browsing forums or
            documentation. Change 'nextpattern' to modify its
            behavior. It follows relations between files too.
[[[count][[
            Follow the link labeled prev,
            previous or < if it exists. Useful
            when browsing forums or documentation. Change
            'previouspattern' to modify its behavior. It
            follows relations between files too.
        * 这2个[[ , ]] 很有用.  可以修改pattern:
        * 默认的nextpattern=\\bnext\\b,^>$,^(>>|?)$,^(>|?),(>|?)$,\\bmore\\b 
            previouspattern=\\bprev|previous\\b,^<$,^(<<|?)$,^(<|?),(<|?)$

Zooming
The zooming commands are dependent on two properties -- a zoom range and a
series of levels within that range.

The absolute value of the page zoom is limited to a value within the configured
zoom range (default: 30%--300%). The zoom levels are used by
zi/zo, and similar commands, to change the zoom value in steps. The
default zoom levels are 30%, 50%, 67%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120%, 133%, 150%,
170%, 200%, 240%, 300%.

The available zoom range can be changed by setting the
'zoom.minPercent' and
'zoom.maxPercent' Firefox
preferences. The zoom levels can be changed using the
'toolkit.ZoomManager.zoomLevels'
preference.

Note: 
    'toolkit.ZoomManager.zoomLevels' is specified as a list of
    values between 0 and 1, not as a percentage.

+zi[count]zi
        Enlarge text zoom of current web page. Mnemonic: zoom in.

zm[count]zm
        Enlarge text zoom of current web page by a larger amount. Mnemonic: zoom more.

-zo[count]zo
        Reduce text zoom of current web page. Mnemonic: zoom out.

zr[count]zr
        Reduce text zoom of current web page by a larger amount. Mnemonic: zoom reduce.

zz[count]zz
            Set text zoom value of current web page. Zoom value can be between 30% and 300%.
            If it is omitted, text zoom is reset to 100%.

zI[count]zI
        Enlarge full zoom of current web page. Mnemonic: zoom in.

zM[count]zM
        Enlarge full zoom of current web page by a larger amount. Mnemonic: zoom more.

zO[count]zO
        Reduce full zoom of current web page. Mnemonic: zoom out.

zR[count]zR
        Reduce full zoom of current web page by a larger amount. Mnemonic: zoom reduce.

zZ[count]zZ
        
            Set full zoom value of current web page. Zoom value can be between 30 and
            300%. If it is omitted, full zoom is reset to 100%.

:zo:zoom:zo[om][!] [value]:zo[om][!] +{value} | -{value}
            Set zoom value of current web page. [value] can be an absolute value
            between 30% and 300% or a relative value if prefixed with "-" or "+". If
            [value] is omitted, zoom is reset to 100%.
            Normally this command operates on the text zoom; if used with [!], it
            operates on full zoom.
         * 这一组记住zi/zo/zz/zm value , 我觉得就足够了.        

Working with frames
:frameo:frameonly:frameo[nly]
        Show only the current frame's page.

copying yanking Copying text

When running in X11, the text of the following commands is not only
copied to the clipboard but is also put into the X11 selection, which
can be pasted with the middle mouse button:
yy
            Yank current location to the clipboard. When running in X11 the location is
            also put into the selection, which can be pasted with the middle mouse button.

YY
        Copy currently selected text to the system clipboard.
      * 这2个都copy到了系统的clipboard,  可以在其他程序中直接<C-V>

Alternate style sheets

Page authors may specify alternate style sheets for an HTML document. Users can
then switch between these various style sheets, selecting their favorite.

:pagest:pagestyle:pagest[yle] [stylesheet]
            Select the author style sheet to apply. If [stylesheet] is not specified
            the page's default style sheet is used.
        All author styling can be removed by setting the 'usermode' option.
