variousVarious commands
:beep:beep
        Play a system beep.

:norm:normal:norm[al][!] {commands}
            Execute Normal mode commands {commands}. This makes it possible to execute
            Normal mode commands typed on the command line. {commands} is executed like it
            is typed. If the [!] is given, mappings will not be used. {commands} should be
            a complete command. {commands} cannot start with a space. Put 1 space before
            it, 1 space is one space.

:run:!:!cmd:!{cmd}
            Run a command. Runs {cmd} through system() and displays its output. Any '!' in
            {cmd} is replaced with the previous external command, but not when there is a
            backslash before the '!', then the backslash is removed.
        
            Warning: Input redirection (< foo) not done, also do not run commands which
            require stdin or it will hang Firefox! It is possible to launch background
            processes, though (e.g. :! xterm &).

:!!:!!
        Repeat last :!cmd.

:sa:sanitize:sa[nitize] [-timespan={timespan}] {item} …:sa[nitize]! [-timespan={timespan}]
            Clear private data items. Where {item} … is a list of private items to
            delete. These may be any of the items valid for 'sanitizeitems'.
            If [!] is specified then 'sanitizeitems' is used for the list of items to
            delete.
            If {timespan} is specified then only items within that timespan are deleted,
            otherwise the value of 'sanitizetimespan' is used.

:sil:silent:sil[ent] {command}
            Execute a command silently. Normal messages and error messages generated by the
            command invocation will not be given and will not be added to the message
            history.

:verb:verbose:[count]verb[ose] {command}
            Execute a command with 'verbose' set to [count]. If [count] is not specified
            then 1 is used as the value.

:ve:version:ve[rsion][!]
            Show version information. You can show the Firefox version page with

<C-[><Esc><Esc>
            Focus content. Exits Command-line or Hints mode and returns to Normal
            mode. Also focuses the web page in case a form field has focus and eats
            our key presses.

ccaret-modec
            Start caret mode. This mode resembles the Vim's Normal mode where you see a
            text cursor and can move around. If you want to select text in this mode, press
            v to start its Visual mode.
            * 我还以为vimperator里面是没有光标的.原来按c ,就进入caret mode 看到光标了.  <Esc>退出.
